Question: 2173
Table: Matches

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| player_id   | int  |
| match_day   | date |
| result      | enum |
+-------------+------+
(player_id, match_day) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of a player, the day of the match they played, and the result of that match.
The result column is an ENUM type of ('Win', 'Draw', 'Lose').

 

The winning streak of a player is the number of consecutive wins uninterrupted by draws or losses.

Write an SQL query to count the longest winning streak for each player.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Matches table:
+-----------+------------+--------+
| player_id | match_day  | result |
+-----------+------------+--------+
| 1         | 2022-01-17 | Win    |
| 1         | 2022-01-18 | Win    |
| 1         | 2022-01-25 | Win    |
| 1         | 2022-01-31 | Draw   |
| 1         | 2022-02-08 | Win    |
| 2         | 2022-02-06 | Lose   |
| 2         | 2022-02-08 | Lose   |
| 3         | 2022-03-30 | Win    |
+-----------+------------+--------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------------+
| player_id | longest_streak |
+-----------+----------------+
| 1         | 3              |
| 2         | 0              |
| 3         | 1              |
+-----------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Player 1:
From 2022-01-17 to 2022-01-25, player 1 won 3 consecutive matches.
On 2022-01-31, player 1 had a draw.
On 2022-02-08, player 1 won a match.
The longest winning streak was 3 matches.

Player 2:

# Solution

-- MySQL

WITH blocks AS
(SELECT player_id, match_day, result, 
 ROW_NUMBER()  OVER 
    (PARTITION BY player_id 
     ORDER BY match_day) -
  SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER 
    (PARTITION BY player_id 
    ORDER BY match_day) AS block  
  FROM matches
 ),
cte AS
(SELECT player_id, 
 SUM(result) AS streak  
 FROM blocks WHERE result = 'Win' 
 GROUP BY player_id, block)

SELECT 
dt.player_id, 
COALESCE(longest_streak,0) AS longest_streak 
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT player_id FROM matches) AS dt  
LEFT JOIN (SELECT player_id, MAX(streak) longest_streak 
           FROM cte GROUP BY player_id) AS dt2
