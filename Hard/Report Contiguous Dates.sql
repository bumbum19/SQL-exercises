Question: 1225
Table: Failed

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
fail_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of failed tasks.

 

Table: Succeeded

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
success_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.

 

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Return the result table ordered by start_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |
| 2019-01-04        |
| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+
Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |
| 2019-01-06        |
+-------------------+
Output: 
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
The report ignored the system state in 2018 as we care about the system in the period 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.
From 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-03 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
From 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-05 all tasks failed and the system state was "failed".
From 2019-01-06 to 2019-01-06 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".

# Solution

WITH t1 AS
(SELECT fail_date date, 'failed' period_state FROM failed 
UNION ALL SELECT success_date date, 'succeeded' period_state FROM succeeded ),
t2 AS
(SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY period_state ORDER BY date) ranking FROM t1 WHERE 
date BETWEEN  '2019-01-01'  AND '2019-12-31' ),
t3 AS 
(SELECT s1.period_state period_state ,s1.date start_date, MAX(s2.date) end_date FROM t2 s1, t2 s2 WHERE s1.ranking <= s2.ranking AND s2.ranking -s1.ranking = DATEDIFF(s2.date,s1.date) AND s1.period_state  = s2.period_state 
GROUP BY 1,2)

SELECT period_state, MIN(start_date) start_date, end_date FROM t3 GROUP BY 1,3 ORDER BY 3
