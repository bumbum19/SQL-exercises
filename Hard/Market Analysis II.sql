Write an SQL query to find for each user whether the brand of the second item (by date) they sold is their favorite brand. If a user sold less than two items, report the answer for that user as no. It is guaranteed that no seller sold more than one item on a day.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

| 4         | no                 |
+-----------+--------------------+
Explanation: 
The answer for the user with id 1 is no because they sold nothing.
The answer for the users with id 2 and 3 is yes because the brands of their second sold items are their favorite brands.
The answer for the user with id 4 is no because the brand of their second sold item is not their favorite brand.

# Solution

WITH t AS 
(SELECT seller_id,   RANK( )OVER (w ORDER BY order_date) second_item, COUNT(*) OVER w item_count, 
item_id FROM orders WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY seller_id  ) )

SELECT user_id seller_id, IF(favorite_brand=item_brand AND second_item=2 ,'yes','no') 2nd_item_fav_brand  
FROM users u LEFT JOIN t ON u.user_id = t.seller_id  NATURAL LEFT JOIN items 
WHERE  second_item = 2 OR item_count=1 OR   item_count IS NULL
