Question: 2494
Table: HallEvents

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| hall_id     | int  |
| start_day   | date |
| end_day     | date |
+-------------+------+
There is no primary key in this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates the start day and end day of an event and the hall in which the event is held.

Â 

Write an SQL query to merge all the overlapping events that are held in the same hall. Two events overlap if they have at least one day in common.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Â 

Example 1:

Input: 
HallEvents table:
+---------+------------+------------+
| hall_id | start_day  | end_day    |
+---------+------------+------------+
| 1       | 2023-01-13 | 2023-01-14 |
| 1       | 2023-01-14 | 2023-01-17 |
| 1       | 2023-01-18 | 2023-01-25 |
| 2       | 2022-12-09 | 2022-12-23 |
| 2       | 2022-12-13 | 2022-12-17 |
| 3       | 2022-12-01 | 2023-01-30 |
+---------+------------+------------+
Output: 
+---------+------------+------------+
| hall_id | start_day  | end_day    |
+---------+------------+------------+
| 1       | 2023-01-13 | 2023-01-17 |
| 1       | 2023-01-18 | 2023-01-25 |
| 2       | 2022-12-09 | 2022-12-23 |
| 3       | 2022-12-01 | 2023-01-30 |
+---------+------------+------------+
Explanation: There are three halls.
Hall 1:
- The two events ["2023-01-13", "2023-01-14"] and ["2023-01-14", "2023-01-17"] overlap. We merge them in one event ["2023-01-13", "2023-01-17"].
- The event ["2023-01-18", "2023-01-25"] does not overlap with any other event, so we leave it as it is.
Hall 2:
- The two events ["2022-12-09", "2022-12-23"] and ["2022-12-13", "2022-12-17"] overlap. We merge them in one event ["2022-12-09", "2022-12-23"].
Hall 3:
- The hall has only one event, so we return it. Note that we only consider the events of each hall separately.

# Solution 

WITH cte AS

(SELECT hall_id, start_day, 
 MAX(end_day) OVER  
  (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY 
   start_day) AS end_day
 FROM HallEvents  ),

cte2 AS 
(SELECT hall_id, start_day, 
 LEAD(start_day) OVER 
  (PARTITION BY hall_id 
   ORDER BY start_day) AS next,
 end_day FROM cte
  ),
 
 cte3 AS 
 (SELECT hall_id, end_day, 
  COALESCE(lag(end_day) OVER 
  (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY 
   end_day),'1900-01-01') AS prev
  FROM cte2 
  WHERE next > end_day OR next IS NULL)

SELECT 
hall_id, 
dt.start_day, 
end_day 
FROM cte3 
JOIN LATERAL
 (SELECT start_day FROM HallEvents 
  WHERE cte3.hall_id = hall_id AND start_day > prev AND 
  start_day <= cte3.end_day 
  ORDER BY start_day LIMIT 1) AS dt;
