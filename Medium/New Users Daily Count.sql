Question: 1107
Table: Traffic

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| activity      | enum    |
| activity_date | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity column is an ENUM type of ('login', 'logout', 'jobs', 'groups', 'homepage').

 

Write an SQL query to reports for every date within at most 90 days from today, the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is 2019-06-30.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Traffic table:
+---------+----------+---------------+
| user_id | activity | activity_date |
+---------+----------+---------------+
| 1       | login    | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | homepage | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | logout   | 2019-05-01    |
| 2       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 2       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 3       | login    | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | jobs     | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | logout   | 2019-01-01    |
| 4       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | groups   | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
+---------+----------+---------------+
Output: 
+------------+-------------+
| login_date | user_count  |
+------------+-------------+
| 2019-05-01 | 1           |
| 2019-06-21 | 2           |
+------------+-------------+
Explanation: 
Note that we only care about dates with non zero user count.
The user with id 5 first logged in on 2019-03-01 so he's not counted on 2019-06-21.

# Solution

WITH cte AS 
(SELECT DISTINCT user_id, activity_date, 
 RANK() OVER 
    (PARTITION BY user_id 
    ORDER BY activity_date) AS ranking
 FROM traffic 
 WHERE activity = 'login' 
)

SELECT 
activity_date AS login_date, 
COUNT(*) AS user_count  
FROM cte 
WHERE ranking = 1 
AND  activity_date >= '2019-04-01' 
AND activity_date < '2019-07-01'  
GROUP BY activity_date;
