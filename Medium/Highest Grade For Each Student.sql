Question: 1112
Table: Enrollments

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(student_id, course_id) is the primary key of this table.

 

Write a SQL query to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest course_id.

Return the result table ordered by student_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Enrollments table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
Output: 
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+

# Solution

WITH max_grd AS
(SELECT 
 student_id, 
 MAX(grade) AS grade 
 FROM enrollments 
 GROUP BY student_id
)

SELECT 
e.student_id, 
MIN(course_id) AS course_id, 
e.grade 
FROM enrollments e 
JOIN max_grd m
  ON e.student_id = m.student_id
  AND e.grade = m. grade
GROUP BY e.student_id, e.grade
ORDER BY student_id;
