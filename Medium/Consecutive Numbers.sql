Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

# Solution

WITH cte AS
(
 SELECT num, 
 LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS num_lag,
 LEAD(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS num_lead 
 FROM logs
 )

SELECT  
DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums  
FROM cte
WHERE num_lag = num 
AND num = num_lead;
