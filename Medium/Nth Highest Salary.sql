Question: 177
Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

 

Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| null                   |
+------------------------+

*/

# Solution

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      WITH cte AS 
      (SELECT salary, 
       DENSE_RANK() OVER 
        (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk 
       FROM employee) 
      
    SELECT 
    DISTINCT salary 
    FROM cte 
    WHERE rnk = N
  );
END
