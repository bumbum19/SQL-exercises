| invoice_id  | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| rest        | int  |
| paid        | int  |
| canceled    | int  |
| refunded    | int  |
+-------------+------+
invoice_id is the primary key for this table and the id of this invoice.
product_id is the id of the product for this invoice.
rest is the amount left to pay for this invoice.
paid is the amount paid for this invoice.
canceled is the amount canceled for this invoice.
refunded is the amount refunded for this invoice.

 

Write an SQL query that will, for all products, return each product name with the total amount due, paid, canceled, and refunded across all invoices.

Return the result table ordered by product_name.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Product table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | name  |
+------------+-------+
| 0          | ham   |
| 1          | bacon |
+------------+-------+
Invoice table:
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
| invoice_id | product_id | rest | paid | canceled | refunded |
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
| 23         | 0          | 2    | 0    | 5        | 0        |
| 12         | 0          | 0    | 4    | 0        | 3        |
| 1          | 1          | 1    | 1    | 0        | 1        |
| 2          | 1          | 1    | 0    | 1        | 1        |
| 3          | 1          | 0    | 1    | 1        | 1        |
| 4          | 1          | 1    | 1    | 1        | 0        |
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
Output: 
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
| name  | rest | paid | canceled | refunded |
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
| bacon | 3    | 3    | 3        | 3        |
| ham   | 2    | 4    | 5        | 3        |
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
Explanation: 
- The amount of money left to pay for bacon is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money paid for bacon is 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money canceled for bacon is 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money refunded for bacon is 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3
- The amount of money left to pay for ham is 2 + 0 = 2
- The amount of money paid for ham is 0 + 4 = 4
- The amount of money canceled for ham is 5 + 0 = 5
- The amount of money refunded for ham is 0 + 3 = 3

# Solution

SELECT 
name, 
COALESCE(SUM(rest),0) AS rest, 
COALESCE(SUM(paid),0) AS paid, 
COALESCE(SUM(canceled),0) AS canceled, 
COALESCE(SUM(refunded),0) AS refunded
FROM product p  
LEFT JOIN invoice i 
  ON p.product_id = i.product_id
GROUP BY name 
ORDER BY name;
